<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, every business wants to create new users and retain the older ones with their mobile applications. To achieve this goal, the businesses must be fulfilling the needs of their potential customers or their target people. This is the reason why mobile applications should focus on providing discretion and interpretation of the business and the thought process that you want to place in front of your users.</p><p><strong>Why does a download and install a mobile application that is dedicated to a purpose when almost everything is available in the Google search? </strong></p><p>This is a classic form of data collection that has now been transformed into sincere mobile applications that are dedicated to the particular needs of users and that simultaneously emphasize a better understanding of the minds of users.</p><p>From machine learning to artificial intelligence, this struggle to make smart mobile applications has reached extremes.</p><p>However, it is strange that mobile application developers act as arbiters of mobile technology. While it may sound like a key, but artificial intelligence and, more appropriately, machine learning has an advantage in converting mobile applications into gold mines for users of applications recently.</p><p>The use of Machine learning &amp; Artificial intelligence technologies has charged up the evolution, creation, and usage of mobile applications.</p><p>Although once the users had to spend several minutes to wait for a customer support partner to be online, the evolution of the virtual assistants has canceled them without hesitation, without exceptions.</p><p><strong>In this blog, we will discuss how ML and AI have revamped the mobile app development scenario these days. Before this, must consider some major concepts involved in this that are mentioned below:</strong></p><p><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9086" src="blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/aiml-feat2.png" alt="" width="800" height="438" srcset="blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/aiml-feat2.png 800w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/aiml-feat2-300x164.png 300w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/aiml-feat2-768x420.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p><p><strong>-&gt; Artificial Intelligence:</strong> It makes a computer work as human beings do. It facilitates tasks that normally require human interaction such as voice recognition, visual perception, decision making and translation between languages.</p><p><strong>-&gt; Machine learning:</strong> It involves educating computer systems to recognize patterns in the way human brains understand them.</p><p><strong>-&gt; Deep learning:</strong> It can be understood as a way to make neurons understand how to solve a particular programming problem.</p><p><strong>-&gt; Neural network:</strong> It involves the interconnection of several networks or nodes or artificial neurons. The output of a neuron acts as an input to the next neuron in the network.</p><p><strong>-&gt; Logistic regression</strong> involves modeling a binomial result with one or more explanatory variables.</p><p><strong>-&gt; Linear regression</strong> implies a linear relationship between individual input variables.</p><h3><strong>Now, let’s have a sneak-peak into how machine learning &amp; artificial intelligence has innovated and eventually transformed mobile application development:</strong></h3><h3>1) Trend Forecasting</h3><p><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9087" src="blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/aiml-trend.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="750" srcset="blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/aiml-trend.jpg 1200w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/aiml-trend-300x188.jpg 300w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/aiml-trend-768x480.jpg 768w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/aiml-trend-1024x640.jpg 1024w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/aiml-trend-960x600.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p><p>AI filters enabled in smartphone applications help forecast the weather. Fun filters help to animate photos in the image gallery, detect the customer&#8217;s face, locate facial features and add filters, etc.</p><p>Some other important features of ML include evaluating real estate, offering customers a virtual tour, informing them of various configurations with augmented reality and making relevant purchasing decisions.</p><h3>2) Security/ Fast authentication</h3><p><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9088" src="blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/aiml-security.png" alt="" width="3383" height="1748" srcset="blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/aiml-security.png 3383w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/aiml-security-300x155.png 300w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/aiml-security-768x397.png 768w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/aiml-security-1024x529.png 1024w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/aiml-security-960x496.png 960w" sizes="(max-width: 3383px) 100vw, 3383px" /></p><p>Facial and fingerprint sensors enabled with AI functions to help determine the essential security functions within applications. These measures may include the recognition of images, the estimation of shipping costs, the automation of product labeling, portfolio management, logistics optimization, and commercial intelligence. Example of an application that implements these: Start of zoom session, BioID, etc.</p><h3>3) Predicting User Behavior</h3><p><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9089" src="blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/aiml-user.png" alt="" width="2742" height="1450" srcset="blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/aiml-user.png 2742w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/aiml-user-300x159.png 300w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/aiml-user-768x406.png 768w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/aiml-user-1024x542.png 1024w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/aiml-user-960x508.png 960w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/aiml-user-341x181.png 341w" sizes="(max-width: 2742px) 100vw, 2742px" /></p><p>ML even helps marketers understand the preferences of the users and the purchase patterns in the application. Then they are asked for a recommendation based on their search behavior, purchase history, and last-minute purchases. These recommendations are based on your age, gender, location, search requests and frequency of use of the application, etc. For example Youboox, JJ Foodservice, Qloo</p><h3>4) Advanced searching</h3><p><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9090" src="blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/aiml-search.jpg" alt="" width="1988" height="1120" srcset="blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/aiml-search.jpg 1988w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/aiml-search-300x169.jpg 300w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/aiml-search-768x433.jpg 768w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/aiml-search-1024x577.jpg 1024w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/aiml-search-960x541.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 1988px) 100vw, 1988px" /></p><p>From the optimization of the search in the application to provide clear and relevant results that are contextual and intuitive, customers can stay connected and interested in the application for longer. The cognitive approach helps to group articles, scripts, documents, frequently asked questions, videos and graphics to provide intelligent and immediate answers to searches.</p><h3>5) Personalization</h3><p><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9091" src="blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/aiml-person.png" alt="" width="4000" height="2250" srcset="blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/aiml-person.png 4000w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/aiml-person-300x169.png 300w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/aiml-person-768x432.png 768w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/aiml-person-1024x576.png 1024w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/aiml-person-960x540.png 960w" sizes="(max-width: 4000px) 100vw, 4000px" /></p><p>Machine learning can help identify users and group them according to their needs from mobile applications. It can be useful to gather information and make a decision about what the application looks like. ML can be useful to determine:</p><p><strong>What are your requirements?</strong></p><p><strong>Who is the target audience?</strong></p><p><strong>What can they pay?</strong></p><p><strong>Is there a particular point that mobile applications need to solve?</strong></p><p>Structuring clients and finding the right approach to meet their needs, by providing relevant content in the application makes the application attractive to the user and gives the impression of communicating with the user in real time. Examples: Taco Bell, Uber, UberEats, Impromed, Migraine Buddy, Optimize Fitness.</p><h3>Conclusion:</h3><p>Machine learning and artificial intelligence essentially empower the mobile application with enough customization features to make it more useful, efficient and effective. These technologies in accordance with the latest style are fast and safe.</p><p>So it is a good idea to employ these technologies for your next mobile app development project. It is one of those defined limits that differentiate your application from that of your competitors.</p><p>Now if you are looking to develop a mobile application with the necessary impulse of AI and ML for your business and make it jump.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the digital age, business growth tactics are constantly evolving. In web development world, we have to deal with various algorithms, platforms and a number of initiatives. Unfortunately, these are not constant and change rapidly.</p><p>Hence, you may require to formulate a strong and successful web strategy to grow your business in this competitive era.</p><p>Therefore, you need some powerful web strategies that can take your business to the next level. In this blog, we will see some of these strategies that can help your company overcome today&#8217;s fierce competition.</p><h3>1) Mobile-friendly websites</h3><p><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9019" src="blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mobilefreindly.jpg" alt="" width="795" height="397" srcset="blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mobilefreindly.jpg 795w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mobilefreindly-300x150.jpg 300w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mobilefreindly-768x384.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 795px) 100vw, 795px" /></p><p>Today mobile applications account for 89% of media time with 11% spent on individual websites. But as a marketer, you must need a smart move to design a strong web development strategy. And, adopting a mobile approach to this can help you out.</p><p>You can also consider the different types of mobile interfaces when you develop your website. But be sure it is suitable for phones. Moreover, it is good to include a lot of changes in the design of interactive material when your website is viewed on a mobile device that provides a better and smoother user experience compared to desktops or laptops.</p><p><strong>Related: <a
href="blog/technology-and-apps/top-web-application-development-trend-in-2018/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=webstrategies-9017&amp;utm_campaign=SMEs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Top 10 Web Application Development Trends To Look In 2019</a></strong></p><h3>2) The great impact of using hero images</h3><p><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9021" src="blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/heroimages.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="500" srcset="blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/heroimages.jpg 900w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/heroimages-300x167.jpg 300w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/heroimages-768x427.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p><p>If you go to your browser and open the Nike or Samsung home pages, then the first thing that greets you is a big and bold image of happy faces with their products. As we know that the human brains process images much faster than text, so, why not take advantage of the same and create your business website around them?</p><p>The use of hero images that appear in the section of the home page of your website is, therefore, a trend that is here to stay. The same goes for large and bold geometric patterns and fonts.</p><p>If you want an even better effect, choose a slideshow format and fill that home page with three or more hero images! The same goes for the videos too. Videos help attract audiences faster and a few seconds of captivating content is enough to keep them hooked to your website for a long time.</p><h3>3) Use RAIL strategy for UX</h3><p><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9022" src="blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/railstrategy.png" alt="" width="1390" height="504" srcset="blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/railstrategy.png 1390w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/railstrategy-300x109.png 300w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/railstrategy-768x278.png 768w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/railstrategy-1024x371.png 1024w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/railstrategy-960x348.png 960w" sizes="(max-width: 1390px) 100vw, 1390px" /></p><p><a
href="hire-developers/hire-web-app-developers?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=webstrategies-9017&amp;utm_campaign=SMEs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Full-Stack web developers</strong></a> of the modern era are no strangers to the RAIL strategy. It allows them to guarantee an excellent user experience on the website. Amplify your RAIL strategy to develop a better perspective for users and define UX based on your findings.</p><p>For the uninitiated, the acronym RAIL means Response, Animation, Inactivity and Load (the four main functions that define UX in any website). Keeping RAIL focused is essential as it contributes to all of the following:-</p><p>-&gt; RAIL offers specific objectives for each of the critical actions taken by the user<br
/>
-&gt; RAIL converts the UX into important actions for users (touch, scroll, drag, and &#8220;like&#8221;)<br
/>
-&gt; RAIL can be a good place to start thinking about the performance factors of your website</p><h3>4) Amazing chatbots and interactive UI</h3><p><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9023" src="blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/chatbots.jpg" alt="" width="760" height="440" srcset="blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/chatbots.jpg 760w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/chatbots-300x174.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /></p><p>Live chats and chatbots are sounding in a new era in the conversational user interface. They make our lives simpler and take care of the automatic response functions with ease. Incorporating the same for your website can be one of the best ways for you to guarantee commitment and a better user experience.</p><p>Virtual assistants help users to buy and help them choose the products and address their problems or queries, which are the next big things in web development. It also helps users overcome the barrier of having to go through complicated navigation processes through their site by including an interactive function based on a simple chatbot on their website.</p><h3>5) Fresh landing pages</h3><p><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9024" src="blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/landingpages.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="418" srcset="blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/landingpages.jpg 800w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/landingpages-300x157.jpg 300w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/landingpages-768x401.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p><p>The landing pages have gone through an endless process of transformation. Moving beyond landing page formats with a large amount of text, we have arrived at light landing pages that focus more on information that the user can easily access.</p><p>Since Internet users do not mind reading even a third of what you write as content, it&#8217;s best to keep the text to a minimum when it comes to designing your landing pages. Use riveted web design templates and features (and tons of CTAs) on your landing page to address the queries and simplified problems of your users.</p><h3>6) Motion UI will stay long</h3><p><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9025" src="blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/motionui.png" alt="" width="1600" height="650" srcset="blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/motionui.png 1600w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/motionui-300x122.png 300w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/motionui-768x312.png 768w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/motionui-1024x416.png 1024w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/motionui-960x390.png 960w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></p><p>Create custom CSS transitions and animations using the motion user interface functions available in the SaaS library. With a more updated version that allows you to work on better transition options, animation queuing and flexible CSS patterns that work in any JS animation library, the motion UI is the next big thing in web development.</p><p>Playing with the motion user interface allows you to explore the navigation functions of a website when you are in a production environment and makes the creation of prototypes very easy. With a lot of aspects of the UI of movement in the current times, it is time to make sure that your website has a lot of resources to make it more attractive to users.</p><p><strong>Related:<a

class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9026" src="blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/staticsite.png" alt="" width="1600" height="800" srcset="blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/staticsite.png 1600w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/staticsite-300x150.png 300w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/staticsite-768x384.png 768w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/staticsite-1024x512.png 1024w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/staticsite-960x480.png 960w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></p><p>The dynamic content of the site can easily be converted to static using static site generators. This is the access tool for most bloggers of the modern era. It guarantees a low budget and a higher loading speed of the site, making its content accessible to users.</p><p>Security factors can also be entrusted to the use of static site generators, and you can convert plain text to creating websites using these site generators. Web developers who like to work on lightweight software that runs on all servers can greatly benefit from this trend.</p><h3>8) JavaScript on high demand</h3><p><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9027" src="blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/javascript.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/javascript.jpg 1280w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/javascript-300x169.jpg 300w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/javascript-768x432.jpg 768w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/javascript-1024x576.jpg 1024w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/javascript-960x540.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p><p>2018 is the year of JavaScript with brilliant frameworks, technologies, and libraries. Riding the wave of JavaScript this year comes to the fundamentals that web developers need to get to the bottom. JavaScript functions such as Built-in, Closures, ES6, Pure Functions, Callbacks, RAIL, Promises, and Node have made web developers around the world realize this.</p><p>Since JavaScript also has the REACT library to create user interfaces, it can be the reference solution for all web developers who are worth their coding skills this year as well. Combine frames like Meteor with library resources, and pave your way to a better website interface in the future.</p><h3>9) Nominal approach to web designs</h3><p><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9028" src="blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/webdesigns.png" alt="" width="1203" height="455" srcset="blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/webdesigns.png 1203w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/webdesigns-300x113.png 300w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/webdesigns-768x290.png 768w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/webdesigns-1024x387.png 1024w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/webdesigns-960x363.png 960w" sizes="(max-width: 1203px) 100vw, 1203px" /></p><p>The white space and the vibrant splashes of color here and there are aesthetically balanced to create optimal comfort for the eyes. That is exactly what happens when it comes to the modern design of websites. Provide a respite to eyes exhausted by endless scrolling throughout the day and make sure your website has a minimalist approach when it comes to material design.</p><p>Less is more in the new era, and a look at Apple&#8217;s website will tell you that. Stay away from elaborate designs and complicated vectors: just a simple icon or picture of books to indicate the assignment help or a marker icon for contact information would suffice.</p><p><strong>Read Also: <a

style="font-weight: 400;">It can not be denied that it is only a matter of time before AI begins to make a big difference in multiple industries and in several areas.</span></p><p><b>Let&#8217;s quickly checkout some major industry names which are benefited with AI today:</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">-&gt; HealthCare</span></p><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">-&gt; Banking</span></p><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">-&gt; Education</span></p><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">-&gt; Agriculture</span></p><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">-&gt; Marketing</span></p><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">-&gt; Automotive</span></p><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">-&gt; E-commerce</span></p><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">-&gt; Food &amp; Beverage industry</span></p><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">In this blog, we will discuss the various reasons for opting Python for AI development projects.</span></p><p><b>1) Less Code</b></p><p><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8985" src="blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/lesscode.png" alt="" width="979" height="505" srcset="blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/lesscode.png 979w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/lesscode-300x155.png 300w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/lesscode-768x396.png 768w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/lesscode-960x495.png 960w" sizes="(max-width: 979px) 100vw, 979px" /></p><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">There are many algorithms involved in AI (Artificial Intelligence). The ease of testing provided by Python makes it one of the best programming languages among competitors. With Python, you can easily write and execute all the codes.</span></p><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Python is able to implement the same logic with a fifth of the code compared to other programming languages based on OOPS. Therefore, this was the first reason why companies prefer Python for AI-based projects. In addition, you must hire a <a
href="web-application-development?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=pythonaiwebdev-8980&amp;utm_campaign=SMEs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>web application development company</strong></a> with experience in AI and Python.</span></p><p><b>2) Great Popularity</b></p><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Python is winning the hearts of millions of <a
href="hire-developers/hire-software-developers-india?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=pythonaiwebdev-8980&amp;utm_campaign=SMEs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">developers</a> worldwide. Python&#8217;s learning facility is attracting new developers to learn this programming language. Although AI-based projects require experienced developers, Python is a learning curve without problems.</span></p><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s easier to hire Python developers instead of looking for a multiprogramming developer. Because its active developer community and its expanded libraries with improved source code and language in development, have led Python to become the languages with more current trends.</span></p><p><b>3) Prebuilt Libraries</b></p><p><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8986" src="blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/prelibraries.png" alt="" width="1527" height="770" srcset="blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/prelibraries.png 1527w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/prelibraries-300x151.png 300w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/prelibraries-768x387.png 768w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/prelibraries-1024x516.png 1024w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/prelibraries-960x484.png 960w" sizes="(max-width: 1527px) 100vw, 1527px" /></p><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Python contains many libraries that you need for your artificial intelligence project (artificial intelligence). Some of these libraries are Numpy for scientific computing, Pybrain for machine learning and Scipy for advanced computing.</span></p><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the other libraries such as AIMA and Norvig can be used for the implementation of algorithms in artificial intelligence. In addition, all these dedicated libraries save developers time. Therefore, if you do not have any knowledge about these libraries, then it is better to hire Python developers who have knowledge about them.</span></p><p><b>4) Flexibility</b></p><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">One of the main benefits of Python is its flexibility. With options to choose between a scripting and OOPS approach, Python is suitable for any purpose. In addition, it also works as a perfect background language and joining different data structures is also suitable for Python.</span></p><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, Python offers the option to verify the majority of the code in the IDE itself and is a great point in favor for the <a
href="dedicated-development-teams?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=pythonaiwebdev-8980&amp;utm_campaign=SMEs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">developers</a> who are fighting between the algorithms.</span></p><p><b>5) Compatibility</b></p><p><img
class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8987" src="blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/compatible.png" alt="" width="800" height="499" srcset="blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/compatible.png 800w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/compatible-300x187.png 300w, blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/compatible-768x479.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Python provides the developer the flexibility to provide an API from the existing programming language, which in fact is extremely flexible for new Python developers. In addition, Python is also independent of the platform.</span></p><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">With only minor changes in the source codes, you can make your project or application work in different operating systems. This saves developers a lot of time to test different operating systems and migrate source codes. Therefore, if you want your AI project to be the best, you should <a
href="hire-developers/hire-web-app-developers?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=pythonaiwebdev-8980&amp;utm_campaign=SMEs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>hire web app developers</strong> </a>who have experience in AI-based projects.</span></p><p><b>6) Full Support</b></p><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Python is an open source programming language with great support from the developer community. There are many resources available that can make any developer solve their problems and problems in a short time.</span></p><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Also, you must not forget that there is a large community of developers of Python developers who are willing to help other Python developers at various stages of their development life cycle.</span></p><p><b>Which Libraries in Python can help you implement AI?</b></p><ul><li><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Scikit-Learn</span></li><li><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Tensorflow</span></li><li><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Numpy</span></li><li><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Keras</span></li><li><span

style="font-weight: 400;">Theano</span></li><li><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Pandas</span></li></ul><p><b>Conclusion:</b></p><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">Artificial intelligence is becoming complicated day by day. And Python is making the AI-based project development process much easier. Due to the shorter line of codes, developers find it easy to write codes in Python. In addition, there are several built-in libraries that can make the AI-based project advanced.</span></p><p><span
style="font-weight: 400;">The simplicity of Python has attracted many developers to create new libraries for AI &amp; machine learning. Due to the huge collection of libraries, Python is becoming very popular among </span><strong><a
href="hire-developers/hire-machine-learning-experts?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=pythonaiwebdev-8980&amp;utm_campaign=SMEs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dedicated machine learning experts</a> </strong>and <span
style="font-weight: 400;">AI developers</span><span

Almost every component of the PHP framework is replaceable. Lithium can return JSON and many other formats from the same actions that render templates increasing productivity in many cases. It handles a &#8220;type&#8221; key in the route which allows it to render various responses with different Content-Types. This is incredibly useful and easy to extend. This combined with closures in routes makes Lithium a very good framework for building a RESTful API.</p><hr
